As the title says we will be making a soundboard that has a gui and a multitude (more than one)
of song clips. Any package is allowed and this will be a great intro to basic GUI building.

*Bonus points if you: Somehow manage to use Snack (I couldn't for the life of me), can
multi-thread a stop button and/or explain to me why the audio quality was terrible when pygame
was used (on multiple devices)

Simple soundboard build using tkinter. Would like to implement loop switch at some point in
the future.
