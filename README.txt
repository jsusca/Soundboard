As the title says we will be making a soundboard that has a gui and a multitude (more than one)
of song clips. Any package is allowed and this will be a great intro to basic GUI building.

*Bonus points if you: Somehow manage to use Snack (I couldn't for the life of me), can
multi-thread a stop button and/or explain to me why the audio quality was terrible when pygame
was used (on multiple devices)
